 <h1 align="center">Fake News Detection Model</h1>
This python project of detecting fake news is conducted with the help of TfidfVectorizer & XGBoost Classifier.The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents intoa matrix of TF-IDF features. XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT)
machine learning library.

(Used web scraping to fetch latest news from the internet and PassiveAggressive Classifier in earlier version.)
